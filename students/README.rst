students directory

Make for yourself a personal directory within this directory.

Within your personal directory we recommend a series of sub directorys which mirror the layout of the class:

*  session01
*  session02
*  session03

Keep each week's work in the corresonding directory.

Use git to share your work with the the instructors and the rest of the class
